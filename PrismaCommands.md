Prisma is a modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js and TypeScript. It helps developers interact with databases in a way that is efficient, type-safe, and easy to work with. Prisma provides a set of powerful commands that allow you to manage the schema, migrate your database, generate the Prisma client, and seed your data, among other tasks.

Here is a list of Prisma CLI commands, along with an explanation of when and how to use each of them:

1. prisma init

Usage: prisma init

Purpose: Initializes a new Prisma project. This command creates the necessary files to set up Prisma in your project, including the Prisma schema, a .env file for your environment variables, and a prisma folder.

When to use:

Use this command when you are setting up Prisma for the first time in your project.

What it does:

Creates the prisma/schema.prisma file.

Creates an empty .env file to store your database connection URL and other environment variables.

Creates a prisma/migrations folder (for migrations).

2. prisma generate

Usage: prisma generate

Purpose: Generates the Prisma client based on your schema file (schema.prisma).

When to use:

Use this command every time you modify your Prisma schema. This is necessary for generating an updated Prisma client that reflects any changes in your models, enums, or other schema definitions.

What it does:

Generates the prisma-client-js in the node_modules folder, which you can import and use in your application.

This is required to interact with your database using Prisma in your code.

3. prisma migrate dev

Usage: prisma migrate dev

Purpose: Applies pending migrations to the database in a development environment.

When to use:

Use this command after modifying the schema to apply migrations to the database in your local development environment. It will automatically generate the required migration files and apply them.

What it does:

Detects changes in your schema and generates migration files (if needed).

Applies the migrations to the database.

Optionally runs a prisma db push to sync the database without creating a migration file if the changes are not schema-breaking.

4. prisma migrate deploy

Usage: prisma migrate deploy

Purpose: Applies migrations to a production or staging environment (where you already have your migrations applied).

When to use:

Use this command in production or staging environments to apply migrations that have been previously generated and committed.

Typically run this on your CI/CD pipeline during deployment.

What it does:

Applies all migrations that haven't been applied to the production/staging database.

5. prisma migrate reset

Usage: prisma migrate reset

Purpose: Resets the database by dropping all tables and applying the migrations again from scratch.

When to use:

Use this command during development when you want to clear your database and reapply all migrations (for example, when the schema changes significantly).

Warning: This will delete all data in the database.

What it does:

Drops all tables and data from the database.

Reapplies all migrations in the correct order.

Optionally seeds the database (if you've set up seeding).

6. prisma migrate status

Usage: prisma migrate status

Purpose: Shows the current status of your migrations, including which migrations have been applied and which are pending.

When to use:

Use this command to check the status of your migrations. It helps you ensure that your database is up-to-date with the migrations defined in your project.

What it does:

Lists all migrations, indicating which ones have been applied and which ones are pending.

Useful for checking if your database is in sync with the migrations you've created.

7. prisma db push

Usage: prisma db push

Purpose: Pushes the Prisma schema directly to the database without generating migration files.

When to use:

Use this command when you want to sync your database schema without creating migration files, typically during early development or in scenarios where you don't need to track migrations.

What it does:

Applies any changes in the Prisma schema directly to the database.

This can be a good option for quick prototyping, but it doesn't track migration history.

8. prisma db seed

Usage: prisma db seed

Purpose: Runs your seed script to populate the database with initial or test data.

When to use:

Use this command to seed the database with initial or test data after running migrations.

You need to create a seed script (e.g., prisma/seed.js or prisma/seed.ts) that defines how the database should be populated.

What it does:

Runs the seed script (e.g., prisma/seed.js) to populate your database with the data you define in it.

9. prisma studio

Usage: prisma studio

Purpose: Opens Prisma Studio, a visual editor for your database.

When to use:

Use this command when you want to view and manipulate your database records through a UI, making it easier to manage your data.

What it does:

Launches a web interface (usually at http://localhost:5555) where you can interact with your database records.

You can browse and edit records in your database, which can be helpful for debugging or during development.

10. prisma validate

Usage: prisma validate

Purpose: Validates the Prisma schema file to ensure that it is correct and does not contain errors.

When to use:

Use this command to validate your schema file before applying migrations, generating the client, or deploying to production.

Helps catch errors or misconfigurations in the schema early.

What it does:

Ensures that the Prisma schema is correct, valid, and free of any syntax errors.

Useful to run before generating the Prisma client or running migrations.

11. prisma format

Usage: prisma format

Purpose: Formats the Prisma schema file to ensure consistent formatting.

When to use:

Use this command to format your Prisma schema file for readability and to ensure that it follows the correct style guide.

What it does:

Reformats your schema.prisma file to have consistent indentation, spacing, and syntax according to the Prisma style guide.

Ensures your schema files are readable and follow the same style.

12. prisma introspect

Usage: prisma introspect

Purpose: Reads an existing database and generates the Prisma schema to match it.

When to use:

Use this command to generate a Prisma schema from an existing database.

Ideal for reverse-engineering an existing database and generating a Prisma schema file based on the current database schema.

What it does:

Introspects an existing database and generates the corresponding Prisma schema (schema.prisma).

Useful for starting a Prisma project with an existing database.

13. prisma migrate resolve

Usage: prisma migrate resolve --applied <migration_name>

Purpose: Marks a migration as applied or rolled back without actually running it.

When to use:

Use this command when you want to manually mark a migration as applied or reverted in the migration history.

Typically used for migrations that were manually applied (e.g., in production) but not tracked by Prisma.

What it does:

Allows you to manage the migration state in scenarios where migrations were manually applied.

Summary of Common Prisma Commands:

prisma init: Set up a new Prisma project.

prisma generate: Generate the Prisma Client.

prisma migrate dev: Apply migrations to the dev database.

prisma migrate deploy: Apply migrations in production or staging.

prisma migrate reset: Reset the database and reapply migrations.

prisma db push: Sync schema with the database (without migrations).

prisma db seed: Run your database seed script.

prisma studio: Open Prisma Studio for visual database management.

prisma validate: Validate your Prisma schema.

prisma introspect: Reverse-engineer a database to generate a schema.

prisma format: Format your schema file for consistency.

These commands are the backbone of your Prisma workflow and will help you interact with your database, manage schema changes, and ensure your database is always in sync with your application code.
